# Tixter
A showtime listing web application

    Moviegoers are looking for the best deals in order to save on theater expenses. Currently, there is no easy way to find the best deal because of the lack of online tools that compare theater admission prices. Sites like Fandango.com and Atomtickets.com do offer prices, but they are inconveniently displayed. Users must individually click on the showtime in order to check the price. If a user wants to compare the prices of the 5 local theaters, they would have to click on a link, memorize the price, then go back and repeat the process 4 more times. That is a long, unnecessary workout and it’s even worse when they have slow data. 
    
    Tixter is a responsive web app that focuses on providing users a table of showtimes, movies, and theaters in the East Bay of the Bay Area in California.  Users will be able to sort the table according to their needs - such as by price or distance. Showtimes will include general admission prices to help users decide from the local theaters. Tixter will initially be available for users in the East Bay.
